title: 'Moving at the Speed of Cloud: Deploy NIOS-X-as-a-Service for Instant DDI'
teaser: Discover how to secure and monitor Generative AI workloads with Infoblox DNS
  controls—across AWS and Bedrock—with real-time visibility, threat detection, and
  hybrid cloud flexibility.
description: "Lab Introduction: Securing Generative AI Workloads with Infoblox DNS
  in Multicloud\n\nThis hands-on lab simulates a real-world, security-first DNS architecture
  supporting Generative AI workloads, using Infoblox NIOS X-as-a-Service across a
  hybrid multicloud environment (AWS ).\n\nParticipants will deploy an application
  (Flask-based or serverless Lambda in a VPC) that sends prompts to Amazon Bedrock,
  receives AI-generated responses with outbound links, and observes DNS resolution
  visibility, filtering, and enforcement via Infoblox.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat You’ll Build:\n\n\U0001F9E0
  AI Assistant Frontend App:\n- Flask or Lambda app submits prompts to Bedrock (Claude/Titan)
  and extracts URLs from the response.\n\U0001F310 Client VPC in AWS:\n- The app resides
  in an AWS VPC simulating enterprise traffic originating from cloud workloads.\n-
  \U0001F510 Secure DNS Hub (two architectural options in addition to NIOS-X-as-a-Service
  that we will do in this Lab):\n- Option 1: Cloud-native DNS (e.g., Route 53 Resolver
  or Azure DNS Forwarder) with conditional forwarding to Infoblox SaaS PoP\n- Option
  2: Direct deployment of vNIOS in AWS or Azure, acting as recursive and policy-aware
  DNS hub\n\n⸻\n\nKey Capabilities Demonstrated:\n\n✅ DNS resolution from AI workloads
  to trusted and AI-generated domains (e.g., webmd.com, cdc.gov)\n\n✅ Real-time detection
  and blocking of simulated malicious AI response domains (e.g., ai-medicine-data.info)\n\n✅
  Enforced DNS policies using Infoblox Threat Intelligence\n\n✅ Visibility of all
  DNS queries in real-time via logs and UI dashboards\n\n✅ Deployment flexibility
  with NIOS-X-as-a-Service\n\n⸻\n\n\U0001F4A1 This lab gives you hands-on experience
  in applying DNS as a security and observability layer for AI-driven workloads. You’ll
  see how Infoblox enables centralized policy enforcement and hybrid DNS visibility,
  even across cloud-native infrastructure."
