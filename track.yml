teaser: 'Zero to DDI in Minutes: Rapid Cloud Networking with Infoblox NIOS-X'
description: "Lab Introduction:\n\nMoving at the Speed of Cloud with NIOS-X-as-a-Service.\n\nThis
  hands-on lab guides you through deploying DNS services using Infoblox NIOS-X-as-a-Service,
  simulating a cloud landing zone rollout for a new AWS region.\n\nYou’ll work as
  part of a CloudOps/NetOps team tasked with bringing up DNS and security services
  in an environment where the rest of the infrastructure — VPC, VPN endpoint, and
  security zones — already exists and is governed centrally by Infoblox UDDI.\n\n⸻\n\n\U0001F680
  What You’ll Do:\n\n- Create DNS and security service instances using NIOS-X-as-a-Service\n-
  Connect them to an existing AWS VPC as part of a landing zone\n- Use an EC2 instance
  in that VPC to test resolution, policy enforcement, and visibility\n\n\n✅ Key Capabilities
  Demonstrated:\n\n- Rapid deployment of authoritative and recursive DNS services
  via Infoblox SaaS\n- Policy enforcement using pre-defined security configurations
  from Threat Defense\n- DNS resolution from a cloud workload via VPC-to-NIOS-X-as-a-Service
  integration\n- Blocking of malicious or unauthorized domains using policy-driven
  security enforcement\n- Real-time DNS query visibility and analytics via the Infoblox
  Portal\n\n\n\U0001F4A1 This lab gives you hands-on experience with cloud-native
  DNS-as-a-Service in minutes — all within a multicloud strategy.\nYou’ll walk away
  with practical knowledge on integrating DNS and security policies into a new cloud
  region at the speed of DevOps.\n\n\U0001F6E1️ Build it fast. Secure it by design.
  Operate it with clarity.\n"
