# Overview

CloudOps and NetOps teams today are under constant pressure to deliver core network services DNS, DHCP, and IPAM (DDI)  at the same  pace of cloud and application teams.Providing DNS manually via virtual appliances no longer scales ‚Äî especially in environments where cost optimization and operational simplicity are paramount.

Enter Infoblox NIOS X-as-a-Service: a fully managed DNS and security service that plugs directly into cloud networks ‚Äî no VMs, no patching, no operational overhead. Just fast, scalable, policy-aligned DNS as a service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NOTE: We offer DDI full package but in this lab the focus stays on core components relvant to the scenario at hand.



# Use Case Story: CloudOps at Speed

Meet Jenna, a CloudOps engineer at a global enterprise. Her team is deploying a new application in  AWS region as part of a global product expansion. This region includes:
- A newly provisioned VPC and VPN
- EC2 workloads requiring immediate name resolution
- DNS and DNS security policies already defined in Infoblox Universal DDI

The networking team ‚Äî led by Max ‚Äî is aligned on one principle: no more spinning up virtual appliances just to deliver DNS. The operational burden, patching schedules, and cloud cost models have forced them to look for a SaaS solution that just plugs in and works.


Here‚Äôs the challenge:
- The landing zone needs to go live today
- DNS must be secured and compliant ‚Äî immediately
- The solution must be cloud-native, cost-efficient, and ops-free

That‚Äôs exactly what NIOS X-as-a-Service delivers.

# DDI in Minutes ‚Äî Without the Baggage

Using the Infoblox SaaS control plane, the  Infoblox Portal,  Jenna:
- Instantiates a new deploy of NIOS-XaaS service using existing DNS and security profiles
- Connects it to the AWS VPC in minutes ‚Äî no agents, no appliances
- Validates DNS resolution and security policy enforcement directly from a test EC2 instance

Infoblox Universal DDI and  Threat Defense provides:
- ‚úÖ Enterprise-grade DNS in the cloud ‚Äî without running infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Real-time enforcement using[RPZs](https://www.infoblox.com/dns-security-resource-center/dns-security-solutions/dns-security-solutions-response-policy-zones-rpz/) and curated threat intel
- ‚úÖ Operational consistency across on-prem, Azure, GCP and AWS ‚Äî all from a single SaaS control plane



# Business Value

Without a SaaS-based DNS and security model:
- Teams are stuck managing virtual appliances and patching cycles
- Cloud environments inherit fragmented, inconsistent DNS policies
- DNS becomes a silo ‚Äî not a security control point

With Infoblox NIOS X-as-a-Service:
- DNS and security services are delivered at cloud speed ‚Äî ops-free
- CloudOps and  NetOps converge around a single, managed DDI platform
- Centralized visibility, unified policy, and consistent enforcement just work ‚Äî **with zero infrastructure burden**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NOTE:** This environment is *real*! AWS Cloud Accounts have been created for each student. No bitcoin mining, please! :)

In this section we will:
1) Review the cloud architecture
2) Login to your cloud account console's
3) Deploy resources onto your cloud regions
4) Create your Infoblox Portal user




---

## 1) Review Cloud Architecture
===

First lets review the cloud architecture that has been provision for your Infoblox Lab experience.

Navigate to the *Lab Diagram* tab above and review the diagram. This is what we're building today!




## 2) Login to your cloud account consoles
===

üîê Access Instructions

Using the credentials below, log in to the AWS  Web Consoles.

---
# AWS Credentials ‚òÅÔ∏è

üîê Logging In to the AWS Console.

üëâ First, open the ‚ÄúAWS Console‚Äù tab on the left-hand side of your Instruqt lab environment. This will launch the AWS login page in a new browser panel.

![Screenshot 2025-07-12 at 11.23.29.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/atmmwsclkofd/86d80bec0e3af0161dbb62f6e26e2626/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-12%20at%2011.23.29.png)

Then follow these steps:
1.	Select ‚ÄúIAM Account‚Äù.
On the login screen, choose IAM Account (not root).

![Screenshot 2025-07-12 at 11.23.29.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/atmmwsclkofd/86d80bec0e3af0161dbb62f6e26e2626/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-12%20at%2011.23.29.png)

2.	Enter the AWS Account ID, AWS IAM username, and password by copying and pasting the values from the section below. Then, log in by clicking Sign In.

üìù Note: Avoid the root account login ‚Äî this lab is configured for IAM users only.

**AWS Account ID**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_ACCOUNT_ID" hostname="shell" ]]
```

**AWS Username**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_USERNAME" hostname="shell" ]]
```

**AWS Password**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_PASSWORD" hostname="shell" ]]
```

## 3) Deploy resources onto your cloud regions
===

üß± Deploying the Lab Infrastructure: Your AWS Landing Zone Starts Here

You‚Äôve logged into the AWS console ‚Äî now it‚Äôs time to build out the cloud-side foundation for our lab. This simulates what you‚Äôd do when bringing up a new region or VPC that needs to connect into your existing DNS and security architecture.

The goal here isn‚Äôt to spin up the kitchen sink ‚Äî it‚Äôs to deploy just enough to simulate real DNS resolution flow through Infoblox NIOS-X as a Service.


üëâ Switch back to the ‚Äú>_ Shell‚Äù tab in the left-side panel of your Instruqt lab to proceed.

---
### 1. Deploy AWS resources in EU

This command sets up the essential building blocks of your cloud-side lab environment:
‚Ä¢	A dedicated VPC and subnet to simulate your new region
‚Ä¢	An Internet Gateway to provide outbound connectivity
‚Ä¢	A VPN Gateway to establish a secure tunnel back to Infoblox
‚Ä¢	One EC2 instance that acts as your client ‚Äî sending real DNS queries into the system


```run
cd ~/infoblox-lab/secure-ai-infoblox/terraform
terraform apply --auto-approve  -target=module.aws__instances_eu -target=aws_vpn_gateway.vgw
```

Next, you‚Äôll deploy the DNS infrastructure, including private zones and the necessary A records ‚Äî exactly as shown in the lab diagram.

```run
cd ~/infoblox-lab/secure-ai-infoblox/terraform
terraform apply --auto-approve -target=aws_route53_zone.private_zone -target=aws_route53_record.dns_records
```
---

ü™£ Deploying S3 for DNS Validation

To simulate DNS resolution and observe policy enforcement against web assets, you‚Äôll deploy an S3 bucket and make it accessible via a custom DNS name.

Split this deployment into two phases to ensure resources are created in the correct order:

### Phase 1: Provision the S3 bucket and apply access restrictions
```run
cd ~/infoblox-lab/secure-ai-infoblox/terraform
terraform apply --auto-approve \
  -target=aws_s3_bucket.infoblox_poc \
  -target=aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.infoblox_poc
```

This creates a secure S3 bucket with public access restrictions ‚Äî preventing unintended exposure while still allowing access via defined DNS.


### Phase 2: Attach the policy, upload a test object, and map it via DNS

```run
cd ~/infoblox-lab/secure-ai-infoblox/terraform
terraform apply --auto-approve \
  -target=aws_s3_bucket_policy.public_access \
  -target=aws_s3_object.uploaded_image \
  -target=aws_route53_record.s3_cname
```

üõ†Ô∏è Terraform will take care of the heavy lifting ‚Äî no console clicking or manual setup. Just wait for the process to finish.

---
‚úÖ Once Complete

You now have a simulated cloud workload in place ‚Äî an EC2 instance that will later send DNS queries through the IPsec tunnel to Infoblox NIOS-X as a Service.

üéØ Next step: Deploy NIOSX-as-a-Service, attach it to the VPC, and test DNS + security enforcement in action.

## 4) Create Admin User to your Infoblox Portal Dashboard
===


> [!NOTE]
> Note: Use your Business Email for User Creation

Your user account and sandbox have already been created. The next step is to set up your password and activate your account.
