üîí Challenge 3: Enhance DNS Security Policy with NIOS-X-as-a-Service
==

Your NIOS-X-as-a-Service instance is already deployed and integrated with your AWS VPC. DNS resolution is confirmed to be working ‚Äî now it‚Äôs time to review the active DNS security protections and enforce stricter controls like blocking adult content.

### üß© Part 1: Review the Active Security Policy

Let‚Äôs begin by reviewing the Security Policy that is currently applied to your NIOS-X-as-a-Service deployment.
1.	Log into the Infoblox Universal DDI Console.
2.	Go to:
**Configure ‚Üí Service Deployment ‚Üí As-a-Service**
3.	Locate your existing NIOS-X-as-a-Service instance.
4.	Under the Service Capabilities, click on the Security section.
5.	Note the name of the assigned Security Profile (e.g., Default Global Policy).

6.	Navigate to:
**Configure ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Policies**
7.	Open the assigned policy and inspect existing rules and threat categories being enforced. Click the Hamburger Icon associated with the Default Global Policy, then click Edit.

![Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 11.14.14.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/26xnz6aweydm/dd5c74475d0b0b914ab9ce74383f5197/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20at%2011.14.14.png)

üéØ Goal: Understand what DNS security protections are active ‚Äî such as blocking malware, DNS tunneling, phishing, and C2 domains.


### üîß Part 2: Clone the Policy and Add Adult Content Block

Now you‚Äôll take it a step further by cloning the policy and adding a rule to explicitly block adult content domains.

1.	In the Policies page, click the hamburger icon next to the Default Global Policy, then  ‚Üí select Clone. Note by cloning the policy, you‚Äôre copying all existing policy rules and creating a new policy.

![Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 11.14.14.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/26xnz6aweydm/dd5c74475d0b0b914ab9ce74383f5197/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20at%2011.14.14.png)

3.	Name the cloned policy: Infoblox-Lab.
4.	Click  the Policy Rules text in the left side-panel.
5.	Click Add Rule ‚Üí choose Category Filter.

![Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 11.17.08.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/26xnz6aweydm/d34f2a5e71cbd036d45a4f37ac3a4179/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20at%2011.17.08.png)

Scroll all the way to the bottom to locate the newly added row.

![Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 11.17.48.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/26xnz6aweydm/6dc47327f9951e65c86eb00bc2901632/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20at%2011.17.48.png)

7.	In the dropdown ‚Üí click New Category Filter
	‚Ä¢	Name it Adult
	‚Ä¢	Move the Adult category to the Selected column
	‚Ä¢	Set Action to: Block ‚Äì No Redirect

	![Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 11.19.36.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/26xnz6aweydm/4583c945daa099518d57a8396c1ae565/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20at%2011.19.36.png)

	![Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 11.19.11.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/26xnz6aweydm/f32ff01da8c304d9c84b7b886a73957d/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20at%2011.19.11.png)


	6.	Click Add ‚Üí and move the rule higher in the rule list (for precedence).
	7.	Click Finish ‚Üí then Save your new policy.

üéØ Goal: Enforce enhanced corporate compliance by blocking access to explicit content domains, ensuring a safe and policy-compliant browsing environment for users across the organization.

This includes categories such as:
- Adult content
- Gambling
- Violence & Hate
- Illegal or unethical content

To achieve this, we leverage Infoblox Threat Intelligence feeds and DNS category filtering. Domains are automatically classified using real-time threat intel and reputation scoring ‚Äî no manual blacklist needed.




### üõ†Ô∏è Part 3: Apply the Enhanced Security Policy to NIOS-X


1.	Navigate back to:
Configure ‚Üí Service Deployment ‚Üí As-a-Service
2.	Edit your existing NIOS-X-as-a-Service instance.
3.	Under Service Capabilities, locate Security ‚Üí click Edit

![Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 11.22.58.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/26xnz6aweydm/5e9b279b407137462d09ca303f307b3e/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20at%2011.22.58.png)

4.	From the Profile dropdown, select your new policy (Infoblox-Lab)

![Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 11.23.06.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/26xnz6aweydm/84ecb89847e4fc0b3ab73787bb8baf71/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20at%2011.23.06.png)

6.	Click Update Capability ‚Üí then click Save

üéØ Goal: Apply the enhanced policy to your service to start enforcing the new rules.


### üß™ Part 4: Validate Policy Enforcement from EC2 (Adult Content Block)

Log back into your EC2 instance and test DNS resolution for an adult content domain ‚Äî this will help verify that your security policy is being actively enforced.

To retrieve your EC2 instance details and SSH command, run:

```run
cd ~/infoblox-lab/secure-ai-infoblox/terraform
terraform output
```

This will display the SSH connection string you can use to access the instance.

![Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 11.25.17.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/26xnz6aweydm/48cfb7698db9a51ee14ec691764e5de3/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20at%2011.25.17.png)

Use the SSH command provided by the previous terraform output step. The public IP address will vary per lab environment.

For example:
```
ssh -i 'EU_WEST_WebProd1.pem' ec2-user@18.171.44.117
```

üß† Replace 18.171.44.117 with the actual IP shown in your output.


Once inside, try resolving a site like:

```run
dig +noall +answer +multiline bet365.com
```



üß™ This sends a DNS query for bet365.com, a known gambling domain (often categorized alongside adult or risky content depending on policy).


üîç Expected Output

If the policy is active, you should see:

![Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 11.34.39.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/26xnz6aweydm/6981bcc57358999ec79b464e95a6f491/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20at%2011.34.39.png)

üìç In the Infoblox Portal, navigate to:

**Monitor ‚Üí Reports ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Security Activity** under Security Events

You‚Äôll see entries like the one below confirming DNS Security enforcement is active:
‚Ä¢	Query: bet365.com
‚Ä¢	Class: CAT
‚Ä¢	Category: Gambling
‚Ä¢	Policy: Infoblox-Lab
‚Ä¢	Source: NIOS X (DPF)
‚Ä¢	Response: NXDOMAIN


![Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 11.34.10.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/26xnz6aweydm/f8d6634c5a21371bfca76d7cf86a192e/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20at%2011.34.10.png)

This means the query was blocked ‚Äî Infoblox Threat Defense returned NXDOMAIN, indicating that the domain resolution was denied by your applied DNS Security policy.

If you instead get a valid IP address, your policy might not be correctly applied or the category/rule isn‚Äôt matched ‚Äî go back and review your Security Policy settings.


üßæ Lab Wrap-Up: Moving at the Speed of Cloud with NIOS-X-as-a-Service
==

In this challenge, you:
- Reviewed the DNS Security Profile assigned to your NIOS-X-as-a-Service deployment
- Cloned and customized the policy to block adult content
- Applied the updated profile to your NIOS-X-as-a-Service instance
- Verified DNS-based enforcement from your EC2 instance
- Observed live telemetry confirming Threat Defense in action

You now have a cloud-native, policy-enforced DNS layer running in AWS ‚Äî deployable in minutes using NIOS-X-as-a-Service.
