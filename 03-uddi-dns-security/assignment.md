üîê GenAI DNS Threat Simulation ‚Äî Key Takeaways

üéØ Objective

Simulate how Generative AI could inadvertently suggest or generate malicious or untrusted domains ‚Äî and demonstrate how Infoblox DNS Security detects, blocks, and logs such queries in real time.

‚∏ª

üß† How It Works in This Demo

‚Ä¢	The Flask app queries AWS Bedrock (or simulates it) to generate a list of ‚Äúhealth-related‚Äù domains ‚Äî some legitimate, some fabricated and suspicious.

‚Ä¢	These domains include:

‚Ä¢	Trusted: webmd.com, cdc.com, mayoclinic.com etc

‚Ä¢	AI-generated but plausible: ai-medicine-data.com, suspicious-healthinfo.com

‚Ä¢	DNS-exfiltration-style FQDNs: chunk1.ai-medicine-data.com, etc.

‚Ä¢	The client issues HTTP requests, triggering DNS queries that are logged and analyzed by Infoblox Threat Insight.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Detection & Policy Enforcement

‚Ä¢	Custom List: For demonstration purposes, we include the AI-generated domains in a Custom List to guarantee consistent detection and show deterministic behavior.

‚Ä¢	In Production: Infoblox DNS Threat Insight can automatically:

‚Ä¢	Detect DNS exfiltration patterns (based on frequency, entropy, and burst behavior).

‚Ä¢	Identify newly observed, low-reputation, or algorithmically generated domains.

‚Ä¢	Enforce policy based on domain classification, DGA detection, or exfiltration heuristics ‚Äî even if the domains are not pre-listed.

‚∏ª

üß© Why Keep the Custom List in the Demo - Custom List usage in Infoblox UDDI Security Policy

‚Ä¢	Ensures repeatable, controlled demo experience

‚Ä¢	Guarantees that AI-generated suspicious domains are blocked and logged regardless of real-time behavior patterns

‚Ä¢	Accelerates time-to-value demonstration in lab conditions


In production, the same DNS queries would be flagged without needing to manually pre-load lists ‚Äî thanks to Infoblox‚Äôs machine learning models, threat feeds, and DGA detection.

üéâ Your DNS policy is now actively protecting the assigned service!





## üß† GenAI DNS Simulation: Detecting AI-Driven Threats via DNS
==

Now that the Secure AI DNS Flask app is running, let‚Äôs walk through how DNS is used to simulate LLM-based data access, and how Infoblox detects and blocks malicious queries triggered by GenAI.

We‚Äôll validate:

1.	‚úÖ The app works and queries the ‚Äúfake‚Äù Bedrock API

2.	üß¨ DNS queries generated by the app are captured by Infoblox

3.	üîê DNS exfiltration attempts or suspicious domains are blocked + logged

---

### üöÄ Step 1: Launch the Flask App

üìç Navigate to the Flask UI

From the left-hand side panel, click on the ‚ÄúFlask UI‚Äù tab to open the application interface.

Alternatively, you can click the button below to launch the Flask UI directly in your current browser tab:

‚¨áÔ∏è

[button label="Flask UI"  background="#c2fbd7" color="green"](http://[[ Instruqt-Var key="SANDBOX_ID" hostname="shell" ]]-websrv1infoblox.iracictechguru.com:5050)

![Screenshot 2025-07-07 at 11.18.47.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/uoielkrmzmtm/9b0c0179cfc40e67193050785e976459/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-07%20at%2011.18.47.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: This UI simulates a GenAI interface powered by Bedrock but using a mock API behind the scenes.

### üí¨ Step 2: Ask a Health-Related Question


Try entering something like:

```
What allergy websites are considered safe?
```

Press Submit.

This triggers the following:

When a doctor submits a question through the Flask UI, the app sends a POST request to the simulated Bedrock endpoint (mimicking interaction with bedrock-runtime.amazonaws.com). Once the GenAI model generates a response, it includes links ‚Äî some of which are legitimate domains (e.g. *.com, *.org) and others crafted to simulate malicious or suspicious behavior.


The Flask app then extracts and resolves these domains, performing real DNS lookups. This includes:

‚Ä¢	Normal FQDNs derived from the AI response (e.g., trusted health sources)

‚Ä¢	As well as intentionally embedded FQDNs that mimic exfiltration-style behavior (like chunk1.ai-medicine-data.com).

These suspicious domains are pre-classified and matched against a Custom List in Infoblox DNS Threat Defense. If a domain is found on the list, it is blocked, and the DNS response will show NXDOMAIN. The system logs this as a policy block event.

Of course due to this simulation we use pre-created Custom List but in reality Infoblox will auto-detect that without loading any pre-configured Custom List.

Throughout this process, DNS visibility is maintained in real time.

The Flask app displays each DNS resolution attempt (including the status: allowed, blocked, or NXDOMAIN) in its UI and logs them to dns_queries.log that is presented in the Flask UI.

![Screenshot 2025-07-07 at 11.39.15.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/uoielkrmzmtm/b232d518a04d78076cef38a292353479/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-07%20at%2011.39.15.png)

Meanwhile, Infoblox Threat View captures all query activity, enabling security teams to analyze, alert, and validate that DNS-based risks from AI-generated traffic are fully observable and controlled.


## üìà DNS Visibility & Threat Auditing in Infoblox Portal
==


Infoblox UDDI Portal provides detailed telemetry and context on every DNS security decision ‚Äî from exfiltration attempts to blocked domains.

Head over to the Infoblox  UI:

Go to: Monitor ‚Üí Reports ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Security Events

![Screenshot 2025-07-04 at 13.54.29.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/uoielkrmzmtm/5896dfdf2f1f3dac503c09eee7e80c76/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-04%20at%2013.54.29.png)


You should see:

‚Ä¢	üî• Domains like *.ai-medicine-data.com

‚Ä¢	üîí Blocked by DNS policy

‚Ä¢	üìâ Threat Level: Low

‚Ä¢	‚úñÔ∏è Response: NXDOMAIN

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Step 1: Validate Real-Time Blocking

üß† What You Just Proved

You simulated a modern AI-assisted workflow ‚Äî and validated that:
- ‚úÖ DNS-layer policies protect against LLM-driven shadow IT
- ‚úÖ AI-generated content can lead to domain risk exposure
- ‚úÖ Infoblox blocks bad FQDNs even if they‚Äôve never been seen before
- ‚úÖ Your SOC can now monitor GenAI output at the DNS level ‚Äî with zero agents, zero endpoint dependency


Go to: Monitor ‚Üí Reports ‚Üí Security ‚Üí ThreatView

![Screenshot 2025-07-04 at 13.54.45.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/uoielkrmzmtm/0cf88355b1c72e79266769278bfa87eb/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-04%20at%2013.54.45.png)

![Screenshot 2025-07-04 at 13.55.23.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/uoielkrmzmtm/28f08a7037aa4ad3a0bcefbb41c0d2d4/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-04%20at%2013.55.23.png)


You‚Äôll see:

‚Ä¢	üö® Total Threats Detected
‚Ä¢	üéØ Top Threat Domains
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Action Taken: Blocked

### üìä Step 2: Global Threat Visibility with Infoblox Security Dashboard

Once your GenAI DNS simulation is running and traffic is flowing, you can use the Infoblox Security Dashboard for a unified view of what‚Äôs happening across your environment.

From the Infoblox UI, go to:

**Monitor ‚Üí Reports ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Security Dashboard**

![Screenshot 2025-07-04 at 13.58.32.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/uoielkrmzmtm/da9c34794c131dd7d4b43fac2545e8df/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-04%20at%2013.58.32.png)

This view gives you instant visibility into:

‚Ä¢	Total DNS Activity ‚Äì including threat-associated queries

‚Ä¢	DNS Firewall Hits ‚Äì how many queries were blocked by policy

‚Ä¢	Threat Activity ‚Äì number of indicators triggered (including Custom Lists)

‚Ä¢	Action Taken ‚Äì confirms enforcement (e.g., block vs. allow)

‚Ä¢	Top Threat Classes ‚Äì e.g., CustomList entries like ai-medicine-data.com

‚Ä¢	Communication Threat Graphs ‚Äì visualizes which domains were queried and blocked

‚Ä¢	Real-Time Traffic Trends ‚Äì DNS query spikes when the Flask app is active

This dashboard is especially powerful in showcasing the impact of GenAI-driven applications. You‚Äôll see spikes in DNS activity, associated blocks, and full lineage of threat domains tied to the AI queries.

> [!NOTE]
> üîÅ Pro Tip: Set the dashboard to auto-refresh every 15 minutes during a live demo and zoom in on the spike generated by the AI app traffic.

This step reinforces DNS as a control point for AI observability, threat prevention, and SOC-level visibility‚Äîall in real time.

### ‚úÖ Summary

You‚Äôve now validated:
- ‚úÖ Client-side policy enforcement
- ‚úÖ DNS resolver config via DHCP
- ‚úÖ Blocked risky categories (gambling, adult)
- ‚úÖ Real-time visibility in the Infoblox Portal
- ‚úÖ Detection of DNS exfiltration attempts with feed-based policy

> Welcome to DNS-layer defense with full visibility. üõ°Ô∏è
